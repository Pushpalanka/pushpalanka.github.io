### The Name
People often ask me about the meaning of my name.

**Pushpa (පුෂ්ප)** means *Flower* in Sinhalese inherited from Sanskrit.
**Lanka (ලංකා)** is the ancient name for my homotherland, *The Resplendent Land* (Sri Lanka).

Together, **Pushpalanka** represents me and my roots. It reminds me that even in the rigid world of digital security, systems must be adaptable to survive.

### The Professional
I am a **Senior Software Engineer** in Platform IAM based in Germany. I contribute to corporate and partner identity access management in the internal developer platform.

For years, I have worked in the trenches of **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. To many, IAM is just a "login box" or a compliance hurdle. To me, it is the **Digital Nervous System** of the modern enterprise.

My expertise lies in the engineering behind the architecture:

* **Modern Auth Protocols:** Deep implementation experience with OIDC, OAuth2, SAML, SCIM and XACML — knowing not just how they work, but when *not* to use them.
* **Authorization at Scale:** Moving beyond simple roles (RBAC) to fine-grained, policy-driven access(Open Policy Agent) that works across distributed systems.
* **Performance Engineering:** I don't just trust the spec; I verify with data. I focus on benchmarking, reducing latency, and optimizing throughput for high-scale identity systems.

### The Philosophy
I believe that good security architecture shouldn't be a locked door that frustrates users. It should be an intelligent ecosystem that recognizes people, adapts to context, and protects the core without stopping the flow of business.

This site is my digital garden, a place where I document my blueprints, my benchmarks, and my perspective on building secure systems as one more string in the human network.
